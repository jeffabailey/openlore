//! `store_read` — the slice-06 READ-ONLY store port (ADR-030).
//!
//! The `openlore ui` viewer reads the operator's OWN node store as
//! server-rendered HTML over a port that exposes NO write/sign surface. This is
//! the structural read-only guarantee (I-VIEW-1 / ADR-030): a `StoreReadPort`
//! trait object cannot mutate the store because the trait declares no mutation
//! method. The adapter (`adapter-duckdb`) implements it over the SAME shared
//! connection the CLI writes through — there is no second handle, no second
//! file (BR-VIEW-4).
//!
//! ## Boundary ADTs (data-models.md §"Read-side query shapes")
//!
//! - [`ClaimRow`] — one own-claim row projected from the `claims` table:
//!   subject/predicate/object/confidence (the DOUBLE numeric, rendered VERBATIM
//!   by the pure viewer core, FR-VIEW-8)/author_did/composed_at/cid. A FLAT,
//!   serialization-friendly shape (DTO, not the rich `SignedClaim`).
//! - [`PageRequest`] — the offset/limit pagination request. For the walking
//!   skeleton (step 01-01) a simple ordered read suffices; full pagination
//!   lands in step 04-01.
//! - [`Page<T>`] — a page of rows plus the total count (so the renderer can
//!   show the "N–M of TOTAL" position indicator later).
//! - [`StoreReadError`] — read failures, surfaced as a plain-language error by
//!   the viewer (NFR-VIEW-6), never a raw stack trace.
