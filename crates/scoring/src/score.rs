//! `score` — the pure scoring entry point + its input/output ADTs.
//!
//! `score(claims, cfg) -> WeightedView` is the single, deterministic entry
//! point. The aggregation (the weight) happens HERE, in pure Rust, NOT in SQL
//! — that is what keeps the aggregate decomposable into its `Contribution`
//! rows (I-GRAPH-2). The body is intentionally minimal for the 01-01
//! bootstrap; the Phase 02 SC scenarios drive the formula fully (Gate 2/3/6).

// `AttributedClaim` is the boundary value the pure scoring core consumes. It
// lives in `ports` (hoisted from here in step 01-02) because BOTH this pure
// core AND the `cli` composition root consume it, and `scoring -> ports`
// (never the reverse) — `ports` is the non-cyclic home. Re-exported via
// `crate::AttributedClaim` (see `lib.rs`) so existing call-sites are unchanged.
